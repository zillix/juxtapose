# juxtapose

NOTE: this is prototype code! it's not meant to be pretty!

juxtapose was originally built for Ludum Dare 30 in 48 hours.
check it out here: http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview&uid=2460

I decided to polish it up, add some additional content, and submit it to Newgrounds.
check it out here: http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/654914

the code is not intended to be clean or pretty! most of it was built in two days, where functionality is valued over reusability or readability.
but feel free to check it out to see how it works!

changes from the Ludum Dare version include:
- 5 new endings (total of 13 endings)
- fullscreen support (press F)
- press 'UP' to view unlocked endings
- hold 'Q' on the title screen for 15 seconds to delete saved data
- minor graphical changes
- many many bugfixes
